## Results & Discussion

This recommender system is a try out how cosine similarity score can be used to find relation between two parameters. The recommender system still requires improvements as cosine similarity is not a one stop solution approach. Cleaning the dataset can help to improve recommendations. Giving proper annotations to the genre, movie name (some titles contain foreign characters), language and region of the title and combining it with rating dataset like IMDB dataset can help provide better qualtiy recommendations.
